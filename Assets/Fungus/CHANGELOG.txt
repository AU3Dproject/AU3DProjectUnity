# Process Changes

We are now using the Unity Test Tools framework for unit and integration testing.
All new features and bug fixes now have automated tests where possible.

# Upgrade Notes

We made a LOT of improvements to the Say Dialogs in this release. Unfortunately these changes are likely to break existing customised Say Dialogs. If you upgrade an existing Fungus project and find the Say Dialog are no longer working you will need to delete your Say Dialogs and create new ones.
